## Final Project Feature Checklist

Complete the checklist below detailing each baseline, custom, and stretch feature you completed in your project. This checklist will help graders look for each feature in the GIF you submit.

### Baseline Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] The project includes an Express backend app and a React frontend app
- [x] The project includes these backend-specific features:

      - [x] the user can **create** a new item, such as notes, categories, tags
      - [x] the user can **update** an existing item by changing some or all of its values, such as changing the title of task
      - [x] the user can **delete** an existing item, such as notes or categories
    - [x] Routes follow proper naming conventions
  - [x] The web app includes the ability to reset the database to its default state
- [ ] The project includes these frontend-specific features:
  - [x] At least one redirection, where users are able to navigate to a new page with a new URL within the app (Login-Registration)
  - [x] At least one interaction that the user can initiate and complete on the same page without navigating to a new page
  - [ ] Dynamic frontend routes created with React Router
  - [x] Hierarchically designed React components
    - [x] Components broken down into categories, including Page and Component types
    - [x] Corresponding container components and presenter components as appropriate
- [ ] The project includes dynamic routes for both frontend and backend apps

### Custom Features

👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Check off each completed feature below.

- [x] The project gracefully handles errors
- [ ] The project includes a one-to-one database relationship
- [x] The project includes a slide-out pane or modal as appropriate for your use case that pops up and covers the page content without navigating away from the current page
- [ ] The project includes a unique field within the join table
- [ ] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [ ] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [x] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
  - [x] *To receive full credit, please be sure to demonstrate in your walkthrough that for certain inputs, the item will NOT be successfully created or updated.*

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[The technical foundation of the project felt very solid. Successfully implementing a monorepo structure allowed for better code sharing and consistency across the front-end and back-end. Additionally, the transition from local development to a stable]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[We encountered significant hurdles with dependency management, particularly when resolving version mismatches between Vite and specific React plugins]

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

[One of the biggest wins was successfully implementing the AI feature]

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

[we have become much more comfortable troubleshooting complex environment issues and feel confident in our ability to take a project from a local npm run dev to a fully secured, live production server.]

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

[We plan to dive deeper into Kubernetes for orchestration and explore advanced security configurations for web applications]
