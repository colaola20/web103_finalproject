## About

### Description and Purpose

Note Board is an interactive notes app where users can create, edit, and delete notes, organize them into categories, add tags, and customize them with different colors.

This app is designed to make the note-taking process more organized, easy to navigate, and reliable. Users can capture notes anytime without worrying about losing them. The app ensures that all notes are stored safely and remain easy to find when needed.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for Note Board came from the common struggle of managing "digital scrap" those quick thoughts, links, and to do lists that often get lost in cluttered messaging apps or physical sticky notes. We wanted to build a centralized, visually intuitive space that mimics the flexibility of a physical corkboard but adds the power of digital searching, tagging, and categorization.

## Tech Stack

Frontend:   React

Backend:    Express

## Features

### Baseline Features
✅ The web app includes an Express backend app and a React frontend app.

- The web app includes dynamic routes for both frontend and backend apps.

- The web app is deployed on Render with all pages and features working.

**Backend Features**
✅ The web app implements at least one of each of the following database relationship in Postgres:
    ✅ one-to-many (user-notes: a user can have many notes, but each note belongs to one user)
    ✅ many-to-many with a join table (tags-categories: a tag can be in many categories and a category can use many tags)

- The web app implements a well-designed RESTful API that:
    - supports all four main request types for a single entity: GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE
        - the user can view items, such as notes
        - the user can create a new item, such as a notes
        - the user can update an existing item by changing some or all of its values, such as changing the title of note
        - the user can delete an existing item, such as a task
    - Implements proper naming conventions for routes.

- The web app includes the ability to reset the database to its default state.

**Frontend Features**
✅ The web app implements at least one redirection, where users are able to navigate to a new page with a new URL within the app (Login -> Registration)

✅ The web app implements at least one interaction that the user can initiate and complete on the same page without navigating to a new page. (Add Note)


- The web app uses dynamic frontend routes created with React Router.

✅ The web app uses hierarchically designed React components:
    ✅ Components are broken down into categories, including page and component types.
    ✅ Corresponding container components and presenter components as appropriate.

- The project is deployed on Render with all pages and features that are visible to the user are working as intended

### Custom Features
